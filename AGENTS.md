# Agent Guidelines for veo-app

This document provides guidelines for AI agents working on the `veo-app` codebase.

## Styling
- Prefer using shared styles from `components/styles.py` for common UI elements and layout structures.
- Page-specific or component-specific styles that are not reusable can be defined locally within those files.

## Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
- All interactions with GCS for storing media or other assets should use the `store_to_gcs` utility function located in `common/storage.py`.
- This function is configurable via `config/default.py` for bucket names.

## Configuration
- Application-level configuration values, such as model IDs, API keys (though avoid hardcoding keys directly), GCS bucket names, and feature flags, should be defined in `config/default.py`.
- Access these configurations by importing `cfg = Default()` from `config.default`.

## State Management
- Global application state (e.g., theme, user information) is managed in `state/state.py`.
- Page-specific UI state should be defined in corresponding files within the `state/` directory (e.g., `state/imagen_state.py`, `state/veo_state.py`).

## Error Handling
- For errors that occur during media generation processes and need to be communicated to the user, use the `GenerationError` custom exception defined in `common/error_handling.py`.
- Display these errors to the user via dialogs or appropriate UI elements.
- Log detailed errors to the console/server logs for debugging.

## Adding New Generative Models
- When adding a new generative model capability (e.g., a new type of image model, a different video model):
    - Add model interaction logic (API calls, request/response handling) to a new file in the `models/` directory (e.g., `models/new_model_name.py`).
    - Create UI components for controlling the new model in a subdirectory under `components/` (e.g., `components/new_model_name/generation_controls.py`).
    - Create a new page for the model in `pages/` (e.g., `pages/new_model_name.py`), utilizing the page scaffold and new components.
    - Define any page-specific state in `state/new_model_name_state.py`.
    - Add relevant configurations to `config/default.py`.
    - Update navigation in `config/navigation.json`.

## Metadata
- When storing metadata for generated media, use the `MediaItem` dataclass from `common/metadata.py` and the `add_media_item_to_firestore` function.
- Ensure all relevant fields in `MediaItem` are populated.

## Testing
- Write unit tests for utility functions and model interaction logic.
- Aim to mock external API calls during unit testing.
- Use `pytest` as the testing framework.

## Code Quality
- Use `ruff` for code formatting and linting. Ensure code is formatted (`ruff format .`) and linted (`ruff check --fix .`) before submitting changes.
